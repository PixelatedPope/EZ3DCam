/*All the EZ3DCam settings are "default" right now. 
 This is a basic 3D cameraat 0,0,0 looking "right".
 But what is "right"?
 objEz3dCam.ezCam's coordinate system is the same as your room's. So "right" is x+
 so if we want to create objects "in front" of the camera, we create them
 at any x position greater than 0. Adjusting their y position will shift them
 left (-) and right(+).
